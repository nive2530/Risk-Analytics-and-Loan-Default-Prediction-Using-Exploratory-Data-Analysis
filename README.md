# Risk-Analytics-and-Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze loan application data and historical loan outcomes to identify the key factors influencing loan defaults. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal was to uncover patterns in customer demographics, loan attributes, and historical payment behavior to better understand the drivers of loan default risk. The insights gained can help optimize loan approval processes, reduce financial risk, and improve decision-making for a consumer finance company.

## Objective
To identify key factors influencing loan defaults and provide actionable insights to optimize loan approval processes, reduce financial risk, and enhance decision-making.

## Key Tasks and Achievements

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Processed and cleaned large-scale data from multiple sources (`application_data.csv` and `previous_application.csv`) by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Standardized variable formats and engineered new features such as the debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-income ratio to enrich the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships between variables and identify potential predictors of loan defaults.
- Visualized default patterns using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to highlight key trends, such as high default rates among specific income groups or loan types.

### Risk Profiling and Feature Engineering
- Segmented customers based on demographic and financial attributes (e.g., income, credit history, and loan tenure) to identify high-risk profiles.
- Analyzed historical loan application statuses (Approved, Refused, Cancelled, or Unused Offers) to understand their impact on default likelihood.

### Insights and Recommendations
- Identified strong predictors of defaults, including low income, high debt-to-income ratio, and poor payment history.
- Proposed strategies such as customized interest rates for high-risk customers, stricter eligibility criteria, and enhanced pre-screening for low-risk customers to optimize approval processes and minimize financial losses.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Languages/Platforms:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Visualization Tools:** Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Management:** SQL for dataset querying and manipulation

## Outcome
The project provided actionable insights to improve risk assessment and portfolio management strategies. The analysis enabled better decision-making for loan approval and risk mitigation, leading to enhanced financial performance for the lending institution.
