# Risk-Analytics-and-Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Objective:
To identify key factors influencing loan defaults and provide actionable insights to optimize loan approval processes, reduce financial risk, and enhance decision-making for a consumer finance company.

Description:
This project focused on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of loan applications and previous loan outcomes using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The aim was to uncover patterns and trends in customer demographics, loan attributes, and historical payment behavior to better understand the drivers of loan default risk.

Key Tasks and Achievements:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Processed and cleaned large-scale data from multiple sources (application_data.csv and previous_application.csv) by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Standardized variable formats and engineered new features, such as the debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-income ratio, to enrich the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore relationships between variables and identify potential predictors of loan defaults.
Visualized default patterns using bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to illustrate key trends, such as high default rates among specific income groups or loan types.
Risk Profiling and Feature Engineering:

Segmented customers based on demographic and financial attributes (e.g., income, credit history, and loan tenure) to identify high-risk profiles.
Analyzed historical loan application statuses (Approved, Refused, Cancelled, or Unused Offers) to understand their impact on default likelihood.
Insights and Recommendations:

Identified strong predictors of defaults, including low income, high debt-to-income ratio, and poor payment history.
Proposed strategies such as customized interest rates for high-risk customers, stricter eligibility criteria, and enhanced pre-screening for low-risk customers to optimize approval processes and minimize financial losses.
Technologies and Tools Used:

Languages/Platforms: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Management: SQL for dataset querying and manipulation
Outcome:
The project provided actionable insights to improve risk assessment and portfolio management strategies, enabling better decision-making and financial performance for the lending institution.
